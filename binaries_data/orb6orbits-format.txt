Fourth Catalog of Interferometric Measurements of Binary Stars: Format

The entries for each binary star system are comprised of two parts: an identification line containing designations from various catalogs, followed by individual measures sorted in order of observation date. Formats of these data are as follows:

Identification line:
Column   Format         Description

   1     t1,a18         Epoch-2000 coordinates, to 0.1s in RA, 1" in DEC when known
                        (HHMMSS.SS+DDMMSS.S)          

   2     t21,a26        Star name #1 (usually ADS or HR number, otherwise DM or 
                        other catalog designation)

   3     t47,a26        Star name #2 (discoverer designation, Bayer, Flamsteed, or 
                        variable star name, GJ number, or other catalog designation)

   4     t73,a13        HD or DM number. Formats are 'HD 123456', 'BD+12 1234', 
                        'CD-1212345', or 'CP-1212345'

   5     t86,a3,1x,a15  Hipparcos, SAO, Tycho-2, GSC, or other designation. The first
                        three characters indicate the catalog (G22 = GSC2.2, UC2 = UCAC2,
                        etc.)

   6     t105,a10       WDS designation or epoch-2000 coordinates in the form of the 
                        WDS designation (HHMMM+DDMM)

   7     t116,a1        General flag:
                          I - uncertainty in catalog match for precise coordinates in 
                              column 1
                          N - note about object in notes file 
                        
   8     t118,a1        Orbit flag. Pair has a published visual or astrometric orbit
                        in the Sixth Orbit Catalog.
                        
Data lines:
Column   Format         Description

   1     t2,a1          Epoch flag:
                          : - epoch not given in paper; the date is estimated based on 
                              comments in the text.
                          < - no information on epoch in text. An upper limit to the date 
                              is given, based on the date of publication.

   2     t3,f9.4        Epoch of observation, given as fraction of the Besselian year 
                        (even though they may have been given in some other form in the 
                        original reference). The number of significant digits in the 
                        epoch reflects the accuracy in the time as quoted in the original 
                        source.  

   3     t14,a1         Position angle flag:
                          V - position angle is vector angle of a one-dimensional (e.g. 
                              occultation) measure
                          : - measure of lower accuracy
                          ? - questionable position angle value

   4     t15,f7.3       Position angle in degrees.  Position angles have occasionally been
                        adjusted to their "proper" quadrant; it should be remembered that
                        interferometry often yields position angle determinations with a
                        180-degree ambiguity.

   5     t23,a1         Position angle error flag:
                          < - quoted error is upper limit             
                          > - quoted error is lower limit  

                        Note: A very small number of measures give errors of 10 degrees
                        or more; hence a "1" or "2" in this column 

   6     t24,f5.3       Position angle error (if given in the original reference).

   7     t29,a1         Separation flag:
                          < - value given is the upper limit for an unresolved measure 
                              (usually the Rayleigh limit, a function of the telescope 
                              aperture and filter)
                          > - value given is a lower limit of the true separation
                          : - measure is of lower accuracy
                          ? - questionable measure or flag for possible duplicity
                          D - separation is in degrees
                          e - pair is elongated (along direction of position angle, if 
                              given)
                          m - separation is in milliarcseconds
                          M - separation is in arcminutes
                          R - pair is noted as being resolved, but no separation is given
                          U - pair is unresolved, but no resolution limit is given

                        Hipparcos non-component double star solutions and suspected 
                        non-single stars are indicated by the following codes: 
                          G - Hipparcos non-component double star solution 
                              (acceleration solution)
                          O - Hipparcos non-component double star solution 
                              (orbit solution)
                          S - Hipparcos suspected non-single
                          V - Hipparcos non-component double star solution 
                              (variability-induced mover)
                          X - Hipparcos non-component double star solution 
                              (stochastic solution)

   8     t30,f10.6      Separation in arcseconds.  For one-dimensional measures this value 
                        is the vector, rather than true separation.  

   9     t41,a1         Separation error flag: 
                          V - published qualitative rating of very poor
                          P - published qualitative rating of poor
                          F - published qualitative rating of fair
                          G - published qualitative rating of good     
                          < - quoted error is an upper limit             
                          > - quoted error is a lower limit  

                        Note: occasionally a paper will quote a range in separation over 
                        which an object is unresolved. In this case (and if the upper 
                        limit is less than 10") columns 7 and 8 will indicate the lower 
                        limit of the separation range, while columns 9 and 10 will 
                        indicate the upper limit, with a ">" flag in column 9.

  10     t42,f8.6       Separation error (if given in the original reference).

  11     t51,a1         Primary magnitude flag. 
                          : - uncertain magnitude estimate
                          > - primary is fainter than indicated magnitude
                          t - value listed is combined magnitude of pair
                          v - primary is variable in magnitude

  12     t52,f6.3       Primary magnitude. 

  13     t59,a1         Primary magnitude error flag:
                          < - error is less than indicated value

  14     t60,f5.3       Primary magnitude error.

  15     t66,a1         Secondary magnitude flag:
                          : - uncertain magnitude estimate
                          < - secondary is brighter than indicated magnitude
                          > - secondary is fainter than indicated magnitude
                          q - author does not gives magnitude information, but notes
                              that reduction technique used (e.g., triple correlation)
                              yields unambiguous quadrant determination
                          s - magnitude is of secondary despite column 12 being blank
                          v - secondary is variable in magnitude

  16     t67,f6.3       Secondary magnitude or, if col 12 is blank, magnitude difference

  17     t74,a1         Secondary magnitude error flag:
                          < - error is less than indicated value
                          
  18     t75,f5.3       Secondary magnitude or magnitude difference error.

  19     t83,f4.0       Filter effective wavelength (in nanometers unless otherwise noted)

  20     t87,f4.0       Filter FWHM (in nanometers unless otherwise noted)

  21     t91,a1         Filter flag:
                          a - average of two or more different filters. Filter columns now
                              indicate mean wavelength and sigma of the filters averaged.
                          c - filter effective wavelength and FWHM are in centimeters
                          m - filter effective wavelength and FWHM are in millimeters
                          M - filter effective wavelength and FWHM are in meters
                          n - no filter used in observation
                          u - filter effective wavelength and FWHM are in microns     
                          x - x-ray band 
                          ? - filter information is uncertain                       

  22     t93,f4.1,a1    Telescope aperture or baseline of multiple-aperture array
                        (in meters, unless noted)  

  23     t97,a1         Telescope aperture code: 
                          k - long-baseline interferometer, baseline in kilometers

  24     t99,i2         "Number of nights". Occasionally published measures are averages 
                        of more than one observation. This practice was more common in 
                        earlier publications; the inclusion of data obtained by eyepiece 
                        interferometry prompted the inclusion of this column. Relative 
                        weighting of measures is typically scaled by the square root of 
                        this value.

  25     t103,a8        Code for the original reference.  Code format is the WDS 
                        Discoverer Designation code (usually the first three letters of 
                        the first author's name), followed by the publication year. An 
                        "a", "b", ...  follow if necessary to differentiate publications
                        by more prolific authors. The list of references is given here.

  26     t112,a3        Technique code. Codes have been merged with those in the WDS and 
                        all other USNO double star catalogs. The list below includes all 
                        codes used in these catalogs, even if not in the interferometric 
                        catalog (old WDS and interferometric catalog codes are included as 
                        well):
